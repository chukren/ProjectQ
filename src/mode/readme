To use ifort, add "setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH "$LD_LIBRARY_PATH":/opt/intel/fc/9.1.031" 
to your  ~/.environ file and do "source ~/.enviro" if you use csh. 


Usage
===============
1 To compile: 
ifort -132 -save -o  love love.for ltable-love.for
ifort -132 -save -o  rayleigh rayleigh.for ltable-rayleigh.for

2 To run: 
1. Edit the model file name in love.in and rayleigh.in
2. love < love.in
3. rayleigh < rayleigh.in

The output files are: love.out  and rayleigh.out 
	(similar to minos output, give phase and group velocity as a function of frequency)
	(they are always calculated at fixed frequencies including frequencies at integers of mhz)

                    : eigf.love and eigf.rayleigh  
	(those are eigenfunction, they can be read)


(3) Read eigenfunctions --- for calculation of Love/Rayleigh Q 
    compile:  
ifort -132 -save -o separate separate.for
ifort -132 -save -o read-eigenfunction   read-eigenfunction.for
   
    run: remove-skip.pl 
         separate.pl 
         read-eigenfunction

WARNING: eigenfunctions have been scaled to the correct normalization and have been multiplied by 
         a factor of 1E09 for plotting purposes, divide the eigenfunction and derivatives by 
         1E09 in calculating the Love or Rayleigh Q factors.
